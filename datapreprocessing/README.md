#Preprocessing ABS Data Files

The data files downloaded from ABS contain random errors introduced to protect privacy of persons. `sa2preprocess.R` script removes the errors using heuristics. We assume household information given in ABS data is more accurate than individual level information. First we adjust household level data to remove any discrepencies. Then individual data is adjusted to match household level data. Still there can be differences between individual and household level data. Such cases are handled when constricuting the synthetic population.

## Prerequisits
Install following list of R libraries

* stringr
* optparse

## Run Instructions

To run with default settings, change directory to `buildpopulation/datapreprocessing/` and run following command:

```
#!shell
> ./sa2preprocess.R
```

Other commandline arguments

```
#!shell
Usage: ./sa2preprocess.R [options]

		Show this help message and exit
```

## Input files from ABS TableBuilder

Default input files are located in `buildpopulation/data/latch/raw/` directory. Default location for the processed files is `buildpopulation/data/latch/absprocessed/SA2/`.
